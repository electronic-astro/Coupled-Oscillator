# Coupled-Oscillator
Coupled oscillators are systems of two or more interacting oscillators that exchange energy via mechanisms such as springs or fields. They are important in physics, engineering, biology, and computing. This article defines coupled oscillators, explains their mathematics, types, applications, and shows how normal modes simplify analysis very useful.
